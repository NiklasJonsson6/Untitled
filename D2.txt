Group: Untitled
Project: Meet a Sweedt - "Fika and Speaka" (Application)


--- Introduction ---
After a lot of different lectures that introduced us to Scrum, how tasks breakdown works 
and general project management, it was finally time for us to apply all this knowledge 
to our project. 
  
--- Process ---
	It took us a little while to start with the process. We talked a few time through 
	our social media channels but that wasn't enough. It was after our 
	first real scrum-meeting that we felt we had a clear plan that we would fullfill. 

	One thing that naturally happened was that we divided ourselves into unofficial smaller 
	groups that processed and worked with different areas like database, IU, matching system, server etc. 
	
	* Challenge
	A challenge we were facing at first was that everyone had alot of different ideas 
	for the application and that lead to very long discussions that lead to us talking 
	in circles without really deciding anything. 
	
	Another challenge we were facing was to set up the work so that everyone had
	something high-priority to do but still didn't conflict with someone else's work. 

	// -------- [mer challenges???]
	
	* Solution
	The solution to our first challenge was that everyone got their chance
	to present their user-story and the group collectively decided priorities.
	We wrote down commpromises and make a list of all the things that needed tp be done. 
	After that we ranked every user-story after after the concluded importance. 

	It was a little bit harder to find the perfect solution to our other challenge....

--- Product ---
	Like mentioned before, the smaller groups of our team worked with different areas, which
	was needed because of the vertical workflow. Our team had a mix of members that was
	familiar with different aspects while unfamiliar with others. This lead to variations in 
	the progress of asigned tasks and affected the vertical work-flow negtively.   

	
	
	The things that are done so far are; an initial layout of the app, the user profiles, the matching 
	algorithm, a basic chat (not yet integrated with the server), and the server and database.

skriva om detta stycke så det låter som vi är färdiga med något iaf? typ:

	Tasks:
	- The matching algorithm and User Interface is completely done.
	- The server and database communication is done.
	- Userinterfaces for logging in/creating a profile is practically done, but not completely linked to server and database
	?- Chat interface is done and messages are stored locally
	


	What we have to do is add more planned features, make the app more easy to navigate and integrate a 
	lot of stuff with the database and server.

	After this sprint we have a few tasks that are unnfinnished. The last sprint we overestimated our
	work velocity which resulted in that a big portion of the tasks worked on were not fully vertically integrated.
	This sprint we will have fewer task, so that the fully vertically integrate the tasks in the sprint backlog.

	We will complete unfinnished tasks from the previous sprint:
	- Integrate signing in/ signing up with server
	
	We will start with new tasks:
	- Add gps
