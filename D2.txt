Project: Meet a Sweedt - "Fika and Speaka" (Application)


--- Introduction ---
After a lot of different lectures that introduced us to Scrum, how tasks breakdown works 
and general project management, it was finally time for us to apply all this knowledge 
to our project. 
  
--- Process ---
	It took us a little while to start with the process. We talked a few time through 
	our social media chanels but that wasn't really enough. It was first after our 
	first real scrum-meeting that we felt we had a plan that we would try to fullfill. 

	One thing that naturally happened was that we divided ourselves into unofficial smaller 
	groups that processed and worked with different areas like database, IU, matching system etc. 
	
	* Challenge
	A challenge we were facing at first was that everyone had alot of different ideas 
	for the application and that lead to very long discussions that lead to us talking 
	in circles without really deciding anything. 
	
	Another challenge we are facing is to set up the work so that everyone has 
	something high-priority to do but still doesn't conflict with someone else's work. 

	// -------- [mer challenges???]
	
	* Solution
	The solution to our first challenge with the ideas was that everyone got their chance
	to present their user-story one last time and together we decided that we need to 
	compromise and make a list of all the things. After that we talked about every user-story
	and ranked them after what the majority of us thought was important. 

	It was a little bit harder to find the perfect solution to our other challenge....

--- Product ---
	Like mentioned before, the smaller groups of our team worked with different areas which
	was good because we need to work vertically. Our team has a mix of members that are
	familiar with different stuff while unfamiliar with other which lead to variations in 
	the progress and that somehow affected the vertical work-flow.   
 
	The things that are done so far are; an initial layout of the app, the user profiles, the matching 
	algorithm, a basic chat (not yet integrated with the server), and the server and database.

	What we have to do is add more planned features, make the app more easy to navigate and integrate a 
	lot of stuff with the database and server.
